class BatchGeneratorBuilder(object):

    This class is a way to build training and
    validation generators that yield each time a tuple (X, y) of mini-batches.
    The generators are built in a way to fit into keras API of `fit_generator`
    (see https://keras.io/models/model/).
    An instance of this class is exposed to users `Classifier` through
    the `fit` function : model fitting is called by using
    "clf.fit(gen_builder)" where `gen_builder` is an instance
    of this class : `BatchGeneratorBuilder`.
    The fit function from `Classifier` should then use the instance
    to build train and validation generators, using the method
    `get_train_valid_generators`

    Yields
    ======

    if y_array is provided (not None):
        it yields each time a tuple (X, y) where X is a list
        of numpy arrays of images and y is a list of ints (labels).
        The length of X and y is `chunk_size` at most (it can be smaller).

    if y_array is not provided (it is None)
        it yields each time X where X is a list of numpy arrays
        of images. The length of X is `chunk_size` at most (it can be
        smaller).
        This is used for testing, where we don't have/need the labels.

    The shape of each element of X in both cases
    is (height, width, color), where color is 1 or 3 or 4 and height/width
    vary according to examples (hence the fact that X is a list instead of
    numpy array).
